# Adult_Income_Machine_Learning_Project
Objective: The goal was to classify individuals' income levels (> $50k or <= $50k) based on demographic features like age, education, and occupation, using the Naive-Bayes and Logistic Regression methods.

Data Source: Data was sourced from Kaggle's Adult Income Dataset, featuring a range of attributes for each individual.

Tools & Technologies: Utilized Python for data preprocessing and analysis, employing pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for visualization, and scikit-learn for implementing the Naive-Bayes and Logistic Regression models.

Methodology: After preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, models were trained to predict income levels. Performance was evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

Key Findings: Both models showed promising results, with Logistic Regression slightly outperforming Naive-Bayes in accuracy. However, Naive-Bayes demonstrated faster training times and simplicity in understanding the outcome.

Challenges: Handling missing data and categorical feature encoding were significant challenges, overcome by adopting a meticulous preprocessing approach.

Learnings: Gained insights into the effectiveness of different machine learning models for classification tasks and the importance of data preprocessing.

Future Work: Plans to explore more sophisticated feature engineering techniques and experiment with other classification algorithms to improve prediction accuracy.
